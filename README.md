Switches the PRS-T1 screen to the black/white mode where it does not flicker

When using unofficial apps, the PRS-T1 e-reader tends to constantly refresh the screen (that effect when flipping a page in the reader app) which is slow and annoying. This app allows you to switch to the black/white mode which is the mode you get when you use pinch to zoom or scroll a web page. Switchin the screen to this mode allows you to play games like Angry Birds as demonstrated at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmx9qoPyz-M
